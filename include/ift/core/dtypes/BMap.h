/**
 * @brief Definition of a Bitmap data struct.
 *
 * Since we the less datasize is 1 byte (char), we need to store the bits in this way. Thus, we have to allocate
 * an array of bytes, so that a single (byte) position in this bitmap can store 8 bitmap elements (8 bits).
 * Note that the less significant bits are the right-most bits from a number.
 *
 * Ex: A bitmap with a byte/char array with 2 values can store 16 bitmap elements (bits).
 *
 *             7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 (storing order of the bitmap elements)
 * [0] =  25 = 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
 *
 *
 *             15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8 (storing order of the bitmap elements)
 * [1] = 100 = 0  1  1  0  0  1  0  0

/**
 * @brief Sets value 1 to the b-th bitmap element.
 *
 * Given that the bitmap has bmap->n elements (bits), we need to find the position [i] in the char/int8 array where
 * the bitmap element is. For that, we have two options:
 * i = floor(b / 8), or
 * i = b >> 3 // shifting 3 bits from a number to the right equals the first option.
 *
 * Once we have found the position in the byte/char array that stores the b-th bitmap elements, we need to set 1
 * in its bit and keep the same bit in the others 7 bits.
 * For that, we want to perform a OR operation between the current bits from [i] and a bit mask with only the required bit as 1.
 *
 * We need to find the bitmap element position in the 8 bits from [i] (remember: the bitmap elements are stored from
 * right to left: see the Struct definition for a better explanation).
 * The bitmap element bis a int32 value. Its 3 less significant bits defines such position in the bits of [i].
 *
 * Ex: b = 35 = 00100011 (bits)
 * i = floor(35 / 8) = 4
 *
 * Suppose we have the following bits stored in this byte position:
 *
 *       39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 (bitmap elements stored into this byte position)
 * [4] = 0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0
 *       0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0 (desired mask to only set 1 in the 35th bitmap element (keeping the remaining bits) after OR operation)
 *
 * Looking for the 3 less significant bits from 35, we have 011 = 3 (operation: b & 0x07).
 * The (3 + 1)th bit in the this byte position is exactly the desired mask.
 * Therefore, we create the desired mask by left-shifting x bits from the number 1 (00000001), where x is the decimal
 * number resulting from the 3 less significant bits from the required bitmap element <b>.
 * x = (b & 0x07)
 * mask = 1 << x
 *
 * Finally, we perform a OR operation between the 8bits from [i] with this mask.
 *
 * @param bmap Bitmap.
 * @param b Required b-th bitmap element.
