Preparing your environment:

You must use Python 3.
The easiest way is to use a virtual env created with python 3, so that the
command python will be python3 by default, and all packages will be installed
into your environment.

0) Creating the virtual env with python 3:
# On your home diretory:
# myenv is the name of your environment
$ virtualenv -p python3 myenv

1) Install PyIFT
$ chmod +x install-pyift.sh
$ ./install-pyift.sh

2) To import the PyIFT package:
> import pyift.pyift as ift

* remove from site-packages in your enviroment *pyift* to guarantee that the above commands will work


* run bash dist-pyift.sh para gerar o whl a ser instalado com pip install dist/<arquivo.whl>
